# Oculus Quest 2

## First impressions
- Installation: easy
- Performance: high
- Sharpness: medium, it is relatively sharp, however requires focus (and is thus extremely personal and depending on eye distrance, headstrap, usage of glasses)
- Usage with glasses: absolutely neccessary to have a suitable glass (not to big)
- Recommendations:
   - Max half our sessions
   - Open the windows
   - Use the elite strap
   - Replace the foam, use a cover
- Overall: this IS immersive, mindboggling, and nothing compared to the Hololens or VR using a phone. Your brain is fooled within 5 seconds, which can lead to 
dangerous situations, e.g. standing in the rollercoaster game is a big NO! (therefore, adequate room is neccesary).

# Hololens 1

## First impressions
- Installation: medium
- Performance: medium (especially streaming the content to an external computer with the developer mode on
- Sharpness: high, however it works the best with optimum light conditions to play immersive games
- Usage with glasses: troublesome, absolutely neccessary to have a suitable glass (not to big)
- Recommendations:
   - Max half our sessions (due to the weight and strap)
- Overall: this IS only AR, certainly shows to potential for mechanics performing maintenance (however, requires a lot of actual data analysis upfront), so would likely be most suited for trainings (however has no advantage over VR). When would AR be an absolute winner? If there would be a micro-version such as google-glass or even contact lenses to enhance certain occupations such as a doctor, mechanic.
